\section{Greedy-based Computing $\NBLap(\Phi)$} \label{sec:greedy}
In this section, we propose an algorithm to compute the under approximation of non-backbone, namely Greedy-based Algorithm. As mentioned in Section \ref{sec:overview}, Greedy-based Algorithm is a straight forward algorithm which is able to compute parts of non-backbone in $O(n^2)$ time. It's able to reduce the number of total SAT calls since literals in $\NBLap(\Phi)$ don't need SAT testings. Experiments show that Greedy-based Algorithm reduces 5\% solving time.

\subsection{Computing $\NBLap(\Phi)$ Using one model}

Given a formula $\Phi$, we first compute a model $\lambda$ using SAT solver. We then compute the set of non-backbone literals using $\lambda$, referred as $L(\Phi,\lambda)$.
% Every literal in $L(\Phi,\lambda)$ only satisfies clauses that has at least two satisfied literals, i.e., $\forall l\in L(\Phi,\lambda), \forall \phi\in\Phi_l, \exists l'\in\phi, \lambda(l')=1$.
To compute $L(\Phi,\lambda)$, we first find clauses that have at least two satisfied literals and put them into a set, refereed as $\Phi_{\models_2}$. We then scan all literals in $\Lit(\Phi)$, and skip literal $l$ and $\neg l$ if $l$ satisfies a clause $\phi\notin\Phi_{\models_2}$. Otherwise, we put it into $L(\Phi,\lambda)$.

The only line in this na\"{\i}ve Algorithm is computing the non-backbone literals set of a given model $\lambda$.

\begin{theorem} \label{lem:navie}
 $L(\Phi,\lambda)\subseteq\NBL(\Phi)$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Suppose a literal $l\in\L(\Phi,\lambda)$. According to the Na\"{\i}ve Algorithm, $\lambda(l)=1$, and there must exists a literal $l'$ in any clause $\phi\in\Phi_l$, such that $l'\in\phi\wedge l'\neq l\wedge\lambda(l')=1$. Therefore, there must exist a model $\lambda'=\lambda[\neg l]$. It concludes that $l$ is a non-backbone literal of $\Phi$, i.e., $l\in\NBL(\Phi)$.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Computing $\NBLap(\Phi)$ Using Greedy-based Algorithm}

To save more SAT testings, we propose the Greedy-based algorithm shown in Algorithm \ref{alg:greedy} to get more non-backbone literals. We use $HS$ to denote the heuristic strategy of greedy algorithm.
% $HS$ greedily find the literal that satisfied the least clauses.
$C$ is an order set of literals, resulted from the heuristic strategy $HS$.
When changing the assignment of a literal $l$, the less clauses $l$ satisfies, the less clauses are affected, the higher possibility that a new model is found.

    }
}
\Return $\NBLap(\Phi)$\;

\label{alg:greedy}
\end{algorithm2e}
Given a formula $\Phi$ and a model $\lambda$, we construct the ordered set of literals $C$ according to $HS$ at Line \ref{alg1:c}. From Line \ref{alg1:loop}, we start to change the assignment of the literal in $C$ one by one. At Line \ref{alg1:sat_test}, for each selected literal $l$, we construct a new assignment $\lambda[\neg l]$ from the model
$\lambda$ and check whether  $\lambda[\neg l]$ satisfies $\Phi$ in polynomial time. If $\lambda[\neg l]$ satisfies $\Phi$, then we add the set of non-backbone literals $L(\Phi,\lambda[\neg l])$ into $\NBLap(\Phi)$, and
assign $\lambda[\neg l]$ to $\lambda$ which will be severed as the model of $\Phi$ at the next step.

\begin{theorem}
$\NBLap(\Phi)\subseteq\NBL(\Phi)$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Suppose a literal $l\in\NBLap(\Phi)$, if $l$ is added to $\NBLap(\Phi)$ at Line \ref{alg1:init}, then $l\in L(\Phi,\lambda)$, $l\in\NBL(\Phi)$ (Theorem \ref{lem:navie}). Otherwise, $l$ is added to $\NBLap(\Phi)$ at Line \ref{alg1:sat_test}, we know that there must exists a model $\lambda'$, $l\in L(\Phi,\lambda')$ (Line \ref{alg1:sat_test}). Since $L(\Phi,\lambda')\subseteq\NBL(\Phi)$ (Theorem \ref{lem:navie}), $l\in\NBL(\Phi)$. It concludes that $\NBLap(\Phi)\subseteq\NBL(\Phi)$.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
The complexity of Greedy-based Algorithm is $O(n^2)$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Started from Line \ref{alg1:init}, we scan all clauses to count number of satisfied literals, and scan all variables to compute $L(\Phi,\lambda)$. The complexity of Line \ref{alg1:init} is $O(n^2)$. With the information collected from Line \ref{alg1:init}, Line \ref{alg1:c} will be finished in $O(nlogn)$ time since it needs to sort a set of literals decreasingly according to $HS$.  Line \ref{alg1:loop} scan all literals, the complexity is $O(n)$. With the information from Line \ref{alg1:init}, Line \ref{alg1:sat_test} will be finished in $O(1)$ time. The complexity of the loop started from \ref{alg1:loop} is $O(n)$. The total complexity of Greedy-based Algorithm is $O(n^2)$.
\end{proof}

Greedy-based Algorithm saved 5\% solving time in total. With non-backbone literals recognized ahead, SAT testing numbers are reduced. Backbone computing is expediting by the save of SAT testings.
