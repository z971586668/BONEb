\begin{abstract}
Backbone is widely used in random SAT solving, \#SAT and planning, etc.
In this paper, we propose a greedy-whitening based approach for computing backbone of propositional Boolean formulae.
We present a greedy-based algorithm with two heuristic searching strategies to compute an under-approximation of non-backbone and
a whitening-based algorithm to compute an approximation of backbone.
The exact backbone is computed by applying iterative test backbone on the approximations.
We implemented our approach in a tool \tool and conducted experiments on instances from Industrial tracks of SAT Competitions
between 2002 and 2016. For industrial benchmarks, experimental results demonstrate that \tool solves as many 34 formulae as \minibones does (72 formulae in total).
\minibones performs better on \textit{mrpp} benchmark (4\% times faster), while \tool performs better on \textit{manthey} benchmark, saving 38\% solving time.
Experiments with 6606 small formulae generated from 86 unsatisfiable formulae indicate that \tool is able to find more backbone quicker when the structure of the formulae are more complex.
