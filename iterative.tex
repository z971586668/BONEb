After computing non-backbone under-approximation $\NBLap(\Phi)$, we construct a set of literals as MINISAT assumptions, which contains literals that are not in $\NBLap(\Phi)$. The interface of assumption in MINISAT is able to return the reason why the given formula is not satisfied under the given assignment (assumption). For example, given a formula $\Phi:=a\wedge(b\vee c)\wedge(a\vee\neg b\vee \neg c)$, $\Phi$ is satisfiable. Given an assumptions $\gamma:=\neg a\wedge\neg b\wedge \neg c$, there does not exist a model of $\Phi$ that satisfy $\Phi$ and $\gamma$ at the same time, $\Phi$ is not satisfied under the assumption $\gamma$, and the reason is $\neg a$. In this case, given an assumption $\gamma$, there is exactly one unsatisfiable under assumption reason of a satisfiable formula $\Phi$, then $a$ must be the backbone of $\Phi$. If there are more than 2 unsatisfiable reasons, there is a chance that none of the reasons is backbone literal. For instance, if $a$ and $b$ are reasons of a given formula with assumptions, it can only indicate that it doesn't exist a model that both $a$ and $b$ are assigned to TRUE, but it's possible that there exists models where $a$ is assigned to TRUE and $b$ is assigned to FALSE, and vice visa. 

We construct an assumption $\gamma:=\Lit(\Phi)\setminus\NBLap(\Phi)$ and find more backbone by testing satisfiability under assumption of $\gamma$. Compared with \cite{JLM15}, less literals are tested, it will reduce the number of total SAT testing. Since a part of non-backbone are removed ahead from assumption, it eliminate some of the reasons where none literals in it is backbone. In this way, removing non-backbone increases the performance of backbone finding using assumptions.
