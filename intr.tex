The \textit{backbone} of a satisfiable formula is a set of literals that are true in all models of the formula,
which plays an important role for understanding the hardness of problems in computation complexity.
For instance, the presence of backbones provides a good explanation for the apparent inevitably high cost of heuristic search near the phase boundary  for satisfiability problem \cite{MZKST99}.

The identification of backbone also has many practical applications. Backbone improves the performance of the random SAT solver like  WalkSAT~\cite{SBK1993} by making biased moves in a local search~\cite{ZWR2003,MAR2007}. For optimization area,  backbone can significantly contribute to the Lin-Kernighan local search algorithms for Travel Salesman Problem~\cite{ZWL2005}. Another recent successful application of backbones is post-silicon fault localisation in integrated circuits~\cite{ZWSM11,ZWM11}.

However, computing backbone is co-NP hard \cite{Jan10}.  Many heuristic approaches were propose to compute backbone in different setting, such as model enumeration, iterative SAT-testing and filtering with modern SAT solvers.
Marques-Silva et al.  conducted an experimental evaluation by integration existing algorithms with optimisations in a modern SAT solver and showed that backbone computation for large practical formulae is feasible \cite{MJML2010,JLMS12,JLM15}.


In this paper, we propose a novel Greedy-Whitening based approach \tool for computing backbones. The insight of this approach has two-folds: 1) we present a fast procedure in to compute an under-approximation non-backbone set, which helps to prune the search space during the computation of backbone; 2) we also construct an approximation of backbone in polynomial time, and the element in this set has high possibility to be a backbone literal.
Finally, we compute the exact backbone using SAT solvers.

We implemented our approach in a tool \tool and evaluated this tool with empirical experiments. We tested 72 satisfiable industrial formulae and automatically generate 6606 formulae from 86 unsatisfiable formulae from SAT competitions\footnote{http://www.satcompetition.org/} during 2002 to 2016. In total, \tool solved 6640 more formulae, 34 from satisfiable industrial formulae and 6606 from generated formulae. \tool reduces 38\% solving time comparing to \minibones in benchmark \textit{mrpp}, and 21\% total solving time.
